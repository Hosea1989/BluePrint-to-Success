# Flutter Programming

## Introduction
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, and the web from a single codebase.

## Why Learn Flutter?
- **Cross-Platform**: Write once, run on multiple platforms.
- **Fast Development**: Hot reload feature allows for quick iterations.
- **Rich UI**: Provides a wide range of customizable widgets.

## Key Features
- **Single Codebase**: Develop apps for multiple platforms with one codebase.
- **Expressive UI**: Build beautiful UIs with Flutter's rich set of widgets.
- **High Performance**: Compiles to native ARM code for fast execution.

## Getting Started
### Installation
- **Flutter SDK**: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **IDE**: Use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Basic Syntax
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Hello, World!')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Hello, World!')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
