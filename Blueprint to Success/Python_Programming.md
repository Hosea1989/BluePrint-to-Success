# Python Programming

## Introduction
Python is a versatile and popular programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.

## Why Learn Python?
- **Easy to Learn**: Python's syntax is straightforward, making it an excellent choice for beginners.
- **Versatile**: Used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
- **Community Support**: A large community provides extensive libraries and frameworks.

## Key Features
- **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.
- **Dynamic Typing**: No need to declare variable types explicitly.
- **Extensive Libraries**: Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow support diverse applications.

## Getting Started
### Installation
- **Download Python**: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **IDE**: Use IDEs like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Basic Syntax
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Data Types
### Strings
```python
name = "John"
```

### Integers
```python
age = 25
```

### Floats
```python
height = 5.9
```

### Booleans
```python
is_student = True
```

## Variables
```python
name = "John"
```

## Data Structures
### Lists
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

### Dictionaries
```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
```

## Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Classes
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

## File Handling
```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

## Error Handling
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
    print(result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero")
```

## Modules
```python
import math
```

## Libraries
### NumPy
```python
import numpy as np
```

### Pandas
```python
import pandas as pd
```

### TensorFlow
```python
import tensorflow as tf
```

## Portfolio Projects
- **Web Development**: Build a simple web application using Flask or Django.
