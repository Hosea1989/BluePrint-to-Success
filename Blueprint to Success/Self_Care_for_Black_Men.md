# Self-Care for Black Men: A Holistic Approach

## Why Self-Care is Important
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, Black men are significantly less likely to seek mental health support due to cultural stigmas and systemic barriers. However, prioritizing self-care is essential for breaking cycles of stress, burnout, and neglect. This guide offers a holistic approach to maintaining physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

## Physical Health

### 1. Exercise Regularly
- **Strength Training**: Incorporate weightlifting or bodyweight exercises 3-4 times a week to build muscle and improve strength.
  - **Day 1**: Upper body (Push-ups, Bench Press, Rows)
  - **Day 2**: Lower body (Squats, Deadlifts, Lunges)
  - **Day 3**: Cardio & Recovery (Jump Rope, Yoga, Meditation)
- **Cardiovascular Exercise**: Engage in activities like running, cycling, or swimming for at least 150 minutes per week to boost heart health.
